- At this point, please do not spam the poll function with votes. If you go fast enough, it can unintentionally log more than one vote for a single user. I do plan to fix this in a later update.
- Automatically verifying and adding developers to access commands (currently hard coded)
- Improve current games
- Add more games
- Add more commands
- Add more developer commands
